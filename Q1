The document and window objects are both important components in web development, but they serve different purposes and have distinct functionalities. 
Here are the key differences between the document and window objects:

Purpose and Scope:

Document Object: The document object represents the HTML document within a window or frame. It provides access to the content and structure of a web page and allows manipulation of its elements,
such as modifying HTML elements, adding or removing content, and accessing form data.
Window Object: The window object represents an open window or tab in a web browser. It encompasses the entire browser window and provides control over the browser's behavior, 
including navigation, resizing, opening new windows, and interacting with the user.

Accessibility:

Document Object: The document object is accessible within the context of a web page. It is typically accessed using the global document variable or through methods and properties available 
to other objects, such as the window object.
Window Object: The window object is accessible globally and represents the browser window or tab itself. It is often accessed using the global window variable and provides access to the 
document object, as well as other browser-related properties and methods.

Functionality:

Document Object: The document object focuses on the content and structure of the web page. It provides methods and properties for manipulating elements, modifying styles, interacting with events, 
accessing and modifying form data, and performing DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation.
Window Object: The window object encompasses broader functionality related to the browser window. It includes methods and properties for navigation (e.g., window.location), timing and intervals 
(e.g., window.setTimeout()), opening and closing windows (e.g., window.open()), managing cookies, accessing browser history, and handling browser-specific features.

Relationship:

Document Object: The document object is a property of the window object, accessible through window.document or simply document. It represents the web page content loaded within the window.
Window Object: The window object is the global object that represents the browser window or tab. It contains properties and methods for managing the window, including the document object as one 
of its properties.
In summary, the document object primarily deals with the content and structure of a web page, while the window object represents the browser window itself and provides control over 
its behavior and features. The document object is a subset of the window object, focusing specifically on the web page's DOM, whereas the window object encompasses a 
broader range of functionality related to the browser environment.
